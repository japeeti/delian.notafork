        <p> I'm currently a Principal at Founders Fund. Before this I was a Principal at Khosla Ventures, the head of growth at Teespring, and the founder of a healthcare company called Nightingale. I'm Bulgarian, I like to ski, and I'm better with computers than people.  </p>
        <p> Here's what I've worked on as an investor so far, i.e. <a href="portfolio"> my portfolio</a> </p>
